There may be small changes in this iteration of the class.Course Description:This course is an introduction to the fundamental techniques used to design algorithms for a wide range of classic problems. You will learn how to use these basic heuristics to design algorithms to solve these classic problems efficiently, as well as variants of these problems that may arise in various applications. Through this process you will gain familarity with the most important and common algorithms which we will study as examples that make use of several basic algorithm design techniques. You will also learn to think about the time and space complexity of algorithms and will learn how to reason about asymptotic complexity. We will not only see how to design algorithms, but how to reason about them and prove that they work, as well as prove guarantees about their runtime.Learning Objectives:To provide students with understanding of, and practice in usingthe most fundamental design tools in an algorithmist's toolkit(greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, using randomization, how to think about algorithms on graphs, reductions, etc.)To provide students familiarity withthe most commonly used fundamental algorithms(searching, sorting, median finding, and some of the most common example applications of all the techniques mentioned above. Also fundamental graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, shortest path finding, minimum spanning tree computation, etc)To give students an understanding oftime and space complexity of algorithms. Specifically: how to calculate the asymptotic runtime of an algorithm.To enable students toreason about algorithms and their run time. Specifically, how to prove the correctness of, as well as runtime guarantees about, the algorithms that we study in this class as well as novel algorithms that you might encounter.To provide students experience not only in designing algorithms, but also inexpressing these algorithms in plain English/ easy to read pseudocode, at an appropriate level of detail.Course Contents:This list of topics is tentative and it is quite possible that we will cover only a subset of these. Please check the syllabus for a detailed course schedule.Algorithms, pseudocode and runtime:What is an algorithm? How to express algorithms in pseudocode/ regular English with an appropriate level of detail. How to reason about the correctness of algorithms as well as their run time.Recursion:The fundamental idea of recursive agorithms. Some examples such as the tower of Hanoi problem. Examples of the Divide and Conquer heuristic (Merge sort, Quick sort, Median finding in linear time, finding the closest pair of points in the plane, Karatsuba's algorithms for multiplication).Asymptotic complexity:Big-O, Omega and Theta. Solving recurrences by substitution (induction). Recursion trees. The Master Theorem.Dynamic Programming:Examples: Rod cutting problems, Longest common subsequence, Knapsack.Greedy algorithms:Examples: Interval Scheduling, Huffman CodesA brief introduction to randomized algorithms and approximation algorithms:basic notions and some introductory examples. The notion of expected run time, high probability bounds and approximation ratios.Graph Algorithms:Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, directed acyclic graphs and topological sort. Decomposing any graph into a directed acyclic graph of its strongly connected components. Minimum spanning trees. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees. Shortest path finding: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall algorithms. Depending on time: max flow min cut theorem and computing matchings in graphs.Algorithmic Complexity:Computability, complexity, complexity classes. P and NP. Reductions both as a tool for proving hardness but also as an invaluable algorithm design tool.Special topics depending on time: Possible topics include computation with privacy (cryptography, e.g. secure multi-party computation) or designing algorithms when agents may have selfish motives to act in their own best interest (algorithmic game theory and mechanism design).Course Activities:Classes:Classes will typically consist of a lecture on the topic interspersed with problem solving/ related activities.Office Hours:Regular office hours will be held by the course instructor as well as TAs. Attendance is optional but highly reccomended.Problem Solving Sessions:Regular problem solving sessions will be held for the purpose of giving the students guided problem solving practice. Attendance is optional but highly reccomended.Course Materials:The class is intended to be self contained. Complete lecture notes will be provided for all the lectures. All problems in the problem sets will also be stated in full.The course textbook isIntroduction to Algorithms (Third Edition) by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest, and C. Stein (ISBN 9780262-033848).Jeff Erickson's textbook, which is availablehere, is also an excellent resource that is available for free online.Evaluation:The course grade will be based on weekly homeworks, a midterm and a final exam. Homework will be focussed on written exercises where you must design an algorithm to solve a problem, express the algorithm clearly, prove it's correctness and then prove a suitable bound on it's asymptotic time complexity. There may be occasional programming exercises.We will adopt a specifications grading framework: that is you will be provided detailed instructions for each task on the homework, as well as an opportunity to resubmit your homework after receiving feedback. The homework will be graded qualitatively. The final letter grade will depend upon how many of the homework problems you satisfactorily complete (including after the opportunity to revise your work) and the exam score (which will take into account both midterm and final scores). More details can be found on the syllabus.Prerequisites:The main prerequistite is some mathematical maturity (in particular a good understanding of the material covered in the discrete mathematics course). No knowledge of algorithms is assumed. Some basic programming experience (in any modern programming language) may be useful for the programming exercises. | Syllabus PDF: Please look at the attachedsyllabus (Winter 2025 version)for full details about the class.

Emphasis is placed on the value of intentionally observing and analyzing the reciprocal relationship between humans and the design of systems in various contexts from a designer or engineer’s perspective. From a practical standpoint, the course addresses the role human-computer interaction (HCI) plays in enhancing the day-to-day human experience and the value of a product to society, while increasing the bottom line for stakeholders. Topics include perception, memory, attention, mental models, accessibility, user/interaction research methods, interface design principles, and design communication strategies.Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this class you will be able to:Understand aspects of cognitive psychology and human factors engineering that apply to human-computer interaction (HCI)Identify components and principles of “good” (and bad) interaction designCritically analyze and evaluate human-computer interaction through empirical research methodsDesign mockups, prototypes, or revisions of interactive systems by applying HCI principlesDevelop strategies for communicating design, usability, and interactivityCourse ComponentsClass AttendanceWeekly attendance is required. Failure to attend class on a regular basis could result in a failing grade in the course. If time of the class sessions will not work for you to attend, you should not take this class. If you miss more than two class sessions during the quarter, please reach out to masters-admin@cs.uchicago.edu to discuss options for a leave of absence or withdrawal from the course.Participation: Discussion, Peer Review, Hot TopicsSharing ideas, insights, and questions in response to the readings, lectures, and demos throughout the course is welcomed and highly encouraged in class and in the discussion channel. Additionally, you are required to find and read at least two articles beyond the course readings on an HCI “hot topic” and share a summary and reflection on those articles by the end of the course. You will also be expected to share your work and provideconstructive feedbackon others’ work throughout the course through an informal peer review process guided by the professor.Lectures & DemosLectures and demos will prepare you for assignments each week. Lectures will cover relevant topics as listed in the schedule and will include interactive and conversational activities. Demos will provide hands-on demonstrations in class on how to use design tools.QuizzesWeekly quizzes, aka “knowledge checks,” will help you to check your comprehension of theories, principles, and applications covered in the readings and lectures.ProjectFour assignments throughout the course (interaction analysis/heuristic review and report, website/system/program/app mockup and prototype, design evaluation and report, re/design and demo) build up to one culminating final report and presentation, which will demonstrate your ability to apply the course principles and topics to an authentic human-computer interaction scenario of your choice. You will identify and work with a team of 2-4 classmates for the project (all group members must collaborate on all assignments); one team member should notify the professor via email of your team’s members and team name by Week 2. Everyone will receive feedback from the professor and fellow students on each assignment along the way so that they may improve their deliverables for the final report and presentation.AssessmentGrade25% Class Participation & Peer Review (Exit Tickets)10% Quizzes65% Project Assignments (10% analysis, 10% mockup/prototype, 10% evaluation, 10% redesign, 25% final report and presentation)Late AssignmentsYou can submit up to 2 late quizzes and 1 late assignment within 3 days (72 hours) of the original deadline without penalty.

There are no formal prerequisites except solid familiarity with Java and optionally familiarity with C++.The course is designed to give students a fundamental introduction to design and architectural patterns as they are implemented in large scale system architectures currently used in industry. Students will be encouraged to explore the various implementation possibilities afforded by these patterns. Trade-offs in terms of performance, development time, maintenance impact, etc. will also be discussed. Students will gain exposure to several industry-leading tools including Apache ActiveMQ and ServiceMix.Specific Learning Objectives include:Recognize and define design and architectural patterns in current common industry useCreate code implementations of these patternsBe able to discuss implementation trade-offs of certain patterns with respect to othersProvide exposure to several industry-standard pattern implementationsUnderstand and be able to implement common code refactoringsCourse ContentsThis course has two different foci: design patterns and architectural patterns.After a brief review of the fundamentals of object orientation, including inheritance and polymorphism, the first focus on design patterns concentrates on several different design patterns or styles, including model-view-controller, factories, template methods, adapters, visitor, iterator, singleton, composite, etc. Historical anticedents of patterns will be reviewed in order to give students a fundamental context in such concepts. Students will work on labs that will give them an opportunity to build software (in Java and optionally C++) that implement these various patterns.The second focus is on a selected architectural pattern metaphor, and this year's focus will be on Enterprise Integration Patterns. Patterns to be covered include Pipes and Filters, Message Queues, Message Broker, Message Bus, Message Channel, Message Router, among others. Concepts in Canonical Data Models will also be covered. Fundamentals including Pub/Sub and Point-to-Point models are covered including message routing, translation, filtering. Apache ActiveMQ and ServiceMix ESB will form the basis for the implementations.Labs will be designed to reinforce lectures and to help students implement each pattern covered. Students will be able to choose which language (Java or C++) in which they wish to work for a given design patterns. All students will work in Java for Integration Pattern implementatons as Java is assumed by ActiveMQ and ServiceMix.CourseworkThere will be 6 laboratory assignments, one every week for the weeks 3 through 8. (the last 3 weeks will be devoted to the course project deliverable):Lab1: Introductory Design Pattern Implementations (Week 3)Lab2: Intermediate Design Pattern Implementations (Week 4)Lab3: Advanced Design Pattern Implementations (Week 5)Lab4: Introduction to Messaging & ActiveMQ/ServiceMQ Environment Setup (Week 6)Lab5: Fundamental Messaging Pattern Implementations (Week 7)Lab6: Advanced Messaging Pattern Implementations (Week 8)There will be a final exam covering the major topics of the course presented in lectures, talks, and reading.Students will work on a course project.

This course revolves around the implementation of an x86 operating system kernel, divided into four separate projects, which accounts for the majority of the grade. Students will develop these projects in pairs. To successfully complete these projects, students must understand fundamental concepts in operating system design and implementation, which are provided through the lectures. There will also be a midterm and a final.The projects use the Pintos instructional kernel, which already implements some of the low-level functionality of the kernel, allowing the students to concentrate on implementing higher-level operating system functionality, such as thread management, memory management, etc.while still allowing them to peek under the hood.The project is divided into four parts:Threads: Students are given a minimally functional thread system, which they will extend to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.User Programs: Pintos already supports loading and running user programs, but no I/O or interactivity is possible. Students will enable programs to interact with the OS via system calls.Virtual Memory: Pintos is limited by the machine’s main memory size. In this project, students will remove this limitation by implementing a virtual memory management system.File Systems: Students will improve Pintos’ basic file system.The project involves large amounts of low-level C programming, and students are assumed to already be comfortable with C Programming. | Student must meet one of the following requirements:- B+ or higher in MPCS 51040 - C Programming- B+ or higher in MPCS 51100 - Advanced Programming- A- or higher in MPCS 51044 - C++ for Advanced Programming (students who have only taken this class should review C before taking OS)Students must have a B+ or higher in MPCS 52011 Introduction to Computer Systems or MPCS 51082 Introduction to Unix Systems. | Student must meet one of the following requirements:- B+ or higher in MPCS 51040 - C Programming- B+ or higher in MPCS 51100 - Advanced Programming- A- or higher in MPCS 51044 - C++ for Advanced Programming (students who have only taken this class should review C before taking OS)","Not approved for CAPP or MACSS students.This course requires competency in Unix and Linux.

There may be small changes in this iteration of the class.Course Description:This course is an introduction to the fundamental techniques used to design algorithms for a wide range of classic problems. You will learn how to use these basic heuristics to design algorithms to solve these classic problems efficiently, as well as variants of these problems that may arise in various applications. Through this process you will gain familarity with the most important and common algorithms which we will study as examples that make use of several basic algorithm design techniques. You will also learn to think about the time and space complexity of algorithms and will learn how to reason about asymptotic complexity. We will not only see how to design algorithms, but how to reason about them and prove that they work, as well as prove guarantees about their runtime.Learning Objectives:To provide students with understanding of, and practice in usingthe most fundamental design tools in an algorithmist's toolkit(greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, using randomization, how to think about algorithms on graphs, reductions, etc.)To provide students familiarity withthe most commonly used fundamental algorithms(searching, sorting, median finding, and some of the most common example applications of all the techniques mentioned above. Also fundamental graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, shortest path finding, minimum spanning tree computation, etc)To give students an understanding oftime and space complexity of algorithms. Specifically: how to calculate the asymptotic runtime of an algorithm.To enable students toreason about algorithms and their run time. Specifically, how to prove the correctness of, as well as runtime guarantees about, the algorithms that we study in this class as well as novel algorithms that you might encounter.To provide students experience not only in designing algorithms, but also inexpressing these algorithms in plain English/ easy to read pseudocode, at an appropriate level of detail.Course Contents:This list of topics is tentative and it is quite possible that we will cover only a subset of these. Please check the syllabus for a detailed course schedule.Algorithms, pseudocode and runtime:What is an algorithm? How to express algorithms in pseudocode/ regular English with an appropriate level of detail. How to reason about the correctness of algorithms as well as their run time.Recursion:The fundamental idea of recursive agorithms. Some examples such as the tower of Hanoi problem. Examples of the Divide and Conquer heuristic (Merge sort, Quick sort, Median finding in linear time, finding the closest pair of points in the plane, Karatsuba's algorithms for multiplication).Asymptotic complexity:Big-O, Omega and Theta. Solving recurrences by substitution (induction). Recursion trees. The Master Theorem.Dynamic Programming:Examples: Rod cutting problems, Longest common subsequence, Knapsack.Greedy algorithms:Examples: Interval Scheduling, Huffman CodesA brief introduction to randomized algorithms and approximation algorithms:basic notions and some introductory examples. The notion of expected run time, high probability bounds and approximation ratios.Graph Algorithms:Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, directed acyclic graphs and topological sort. Decomposing any graph into a directed acyclic graph of its strongly connected components. Minimum spanning trees. Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees. Shortest path finding: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall algorithms. Depending on time: max flow min cut theorem and computing matchings in graphs.Algorithmic Complexity:Computability, complexity, complexity classes. P and NP. Reductions both as a tool for proving hardness but also as an invaluable algorithm design tool.Special topics depending on time: Possible topics include computation with privacy (cryptography, e.g. secure multi-party computation) or designing algorithms when agents may have selfish motives to act in their own best interest (algorithmic game theory and mechanism design).Course Activities:Classes:Classes will typically consist of a lecture on the topic interspersed with problem solving/ related activities.Office Hours:Regular office hours will be held by the course instructor as well as TAs. Attendance is optional but highly reccomended.Problem Solving Sessions:Regular problem solving sessions will be held for the purpose of giving the students guided problem solving practice. Attendance is optional but highly reccomended.Course Materials:The class is intended to be self contained. Complete lecture notes will be provided for all the lectures. All problems in the problem sets will also be stated in full.The course textbook isIntroduction to Algorithms (Third Edition) by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest, and C. Stein (ISBN 9780262-033848).Jeff Erickson's textbook, which is availablehere, is also an excellent resource that is available for free online.Evaluation:The course grade will be based on weekly homeworks, a midterm and a final exam. Homework will be focussed on written exercises where you must design an algorithm to solve a problem, express the algorithm clearly, prove it's correctness and then prove a suitable bound on it's asymptotic time complexity. There may be occasional programming exercises.We will adopt a specifications grading framework: that is you will be provided detailed instructions for each task on the homework, as well as an opportunity to resubmit your homework after receiving feedback. The homework will be graded qualitatively. The final letter grade will depend upon how many of the homework problems you satisfactorily complete (including after the opportunity to revise your work) and the exam score (which will take into account both midterm and final scores). More details can be found on the syllabus.Prerequisites:The main prerequistite is some mathematical maturity (in particular a good understanding of the material covered in the discrete mathematics course). No knowledge of algorithms is assumed. Some basic programming experience (in any modern programming language) may be useful for the programming exercises. | Course Overview [Watch Video]Syllabus PDF: Please look at the attachedsyllabus (Winter 2025 version)for full details about the class.

Concepts covered include entity sets and relationships, using keys as a unique identifier for each object in an entity set, one-one, many-one, and many-many relationships as well as translational rules from conceptual modeling (ERD) to relational table definitions. We will examine the relational model and functional dependencies along with their application to the methods for improving database design: normal forms and normalization.After designing and modeling their database, students will learn the universal language of relational databases: SQL (Structured Query Language). We will first introduce relational algebra, the theoretical foundation of SQL and then examine in detail the two main aspects of SQL: data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML). Concepts covered include subqueries, aggregation, various types of joins, functions, triggers and stored procedures. Students will then learn about web connectivity, as they build a simple front-end for their application in order to interact with their database online. Finally, we will provide an overview of related topics such as data warehousing, big data, NoSQL and NewSQL databases.Students will gain significant experience with writing and reading SQL queries and understanding the design and function of relational databases throughout the course in the detailed in-class discussions, online homework, midterm and the real-world individual project.Course Contents• Requirements gatheringEntity-Relationship model and designDatabase designRelational modelFunctional dependenciesNormal forms and normalizationRelational algebraSQL: Schema definition, Simple queriesSubqueries, Aggregation, ModificationsJoins, Views, Indexing, ConstraintsTransactions, ACID propertiesAuthorizationTriggersFunctions/Stored proceduresDatabase connectivityBasic web programmingData warehousing overviewBig data/NoSQL overviewCourseworkHomework (weekly) (~15%)Multi-part project (weekly) (~50%)Midterm (~30%)Class participation (~5%)Recommended TextbooksDatabase System Concepts Seventh Editionhttps://www.db-book.com/db7/index.html | In this course students will learn database design and development and will build a simple but complete web application powered by a relational database.We start by gathering requirements and showing how to model a relational database using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

The functional paradigm isn't a language or technology--it's an entire school of thought on what a computer program is and how to write one. It has a long history, based on a model of computation developed by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 30s. The functional paradigm contrasts with the imperative paradigm, which most of today's existing software is written in. But although the functional paradigm has yet to go fully mainstream, the imperative world has been taking most of its bleeding-edge ideas about software design from the functional world, particularly in recent years. And to all appearances, that trend is on the rise, with expansive new purely functional software and tooling currently under development at companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and countless others. In addition, the library ecosystem for languages such as Haskell and OCaml has become sufficiently rich and extensive that an increasing proportion of today's successful software companies (including Jane Street Capital and Input-Output) have been able to develop their entire code base purely functionally.There are a lot of ways to characterize the difference between programming in the functional style and programming in the imperative style. But just to whet your appetite, the language we will be working with has the following distinctive features:+ every data structure is immutable+ there is no shared state between functions+ every expression must be well-typed at compile time+ types can be inferred, and therefore need not be declared+ data modeling is done using algebraic data types+ functions can be made general-purpose with polymorphic types+ interfaces are built using ad-hoc polymorphism, a.k.a. 'type classes'The language of this course is Haskell. Haskell is arguably the main agenda-setter for the functional paradigm, and it is also somewhat challenging to learn outside of a class. At least in the opinion of this instructor, knowing your way around Haskell puts you in an excellent position to get going with other functional languages. That said, although we will spend a lot of time becoming intimately acquainted with Haskell, the main goal of this class is to focus on big-picture concepts that can be readily ported to other languages and technologies--in some cases including languages with limited support for the functional style. The functional style offers a wide array of data structures, patterns, and techniques that are nearly indispensable for writing clean, modular, maintainable, bug-free code that runs blazingly fast. These are all methods that any software developer can benefit from having in their personal toolkit.COURSE CONTENTThe week-by-week breakdown of topics will be as follows:Week 1: Haskell basics, linked lists, recursionWeek 2: point-free, lazy evaluation, algebraic datatypesWeek 3: type classes, basic IO, Maybe and EitherWeek 4: functors, intro to applicatives and monadsWeek 5: more monads, a little more IOWeek 6: midterm exam, the State monadWeek 7: intro to applicative parsingWeek 8: monad transformersWeek 9: lazy evaluation, conclusion, final projectCOURSEWORKWork for the course consists of short weekly readings, weekly code exercises, a midterm exam, and a final project. The weekly exercises are intended to be challenging but hopefully also fun. They will not presuppose any prior familiarity with functional programming. The bulk of the final project is written piecemeal every week as part of the homework, with the final two weeks set aside for finalizing it.COURSE TEXTBOOKSThe main text for this class is the homework assignments, which are intended to be read week by week, like a textbook. However, we will also be reading the first half ofFinding Success (and Failure) in Haskell, by Julie Moronuki and Chris Martin, which can be purchased here:https://leanpub.com/finding-success-in-haskellMoronuki and Martin's book is simply incredible, and highly recommended for anyone who would like to get started with Haskell.We won't be using any general textbook in this class, but if you are looking for a general-purpose Haskell book to use for reference, Graham Hutton'sProgramming in Haskell(second edition) is excellent:http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html | This course requires competency in Unix and Linux.

Emphasis is placed on the value of intentionally observing and analyzing the reciprocal relationship between humans and the design of systems in various contexts from a designer or engineer’s perspective. From a practical standpoint, the course addresses the role human-computer interaction (HCI) plays in enhancing the day-to-day human experience and the value of a product to society, while increasing the bottom line for stakeholders. Topics include perception, memory, attention, mental models, accessibility, user/interaction research methods, interface design principles, and design communication strategies.Learning ObjectivesAt the end of this class you will be able to:Understand aspects of cognitive psychology and human factors engineering that apply to human-computer interaction (HCI)Identify components and principles of “good” (and bad) interaction designCritically analyze and evaluate human-computer interaction through empirical research methodsDesign mockups, prototypes, or revisions of interactive systems by applying HCI principlesDevelop strategies for communicating design, usability, and interactivityCourse ComponentsClass AttendanceWeekly attendance is required. Failure to attend class on a regular basis could result in a failing grade in the course. If time of the class sessions will not work for you to attend, you should not take this class. If you miss more than two class sessions during the quarter, please reach out to masters-admin@cs.uchicago.edu to discuss options for a leave of absence or withdrawal from the course.Participation: Discussion, Peer Review, Hot TopicsSharing ideas, insights, and questions in response to the readings, lectures, and demos throughout the course is welcomed and highly encouraged in class and in the discussion channel. Additionally, you are required to find and read at least two articles beyond the course readings on an HCI “hot topic” and share a summary and reflection on those articles by the end of the course. You will also be expected to share your work and provideconstructive feedbackon others’ work throughout the course through an informal peer review process guided by the professor.Lectures & DemosLectures and demos will prepare you for assignments each week. Lectures will cover relevant topics as listed in the schedule and will include interactive and conversational activities. Demos will provide hands-on demonstrations in class on how to use design tools.QuizzesWeekly quizzes, aka “knowledge checks,” will help you to check your comprehension of theories, principles, and applications covered in the readings and lectures.ProjectFour assignments throughout the course (interaction analysis/heuristic review and report, website/system/program/app mockup and prototype, design evaluation and report, re/design and demo) build up to one culminating final report and presentation, which will demonstrate your ability to apply the course principles and topics to an authentic human-computer interaction scenario of your choice. You will identify and work with a team of 2-4 classmates for the project (all group members must collaborate on all assignments); one team member should notify the professor via email of your team’s members and team name by Week 2.

Emphasis is placed on the value of intentionally observing and analyzing the reciprocal relationship between humans and the design of systems in various contexts from a designer or engineer’s perspective. From a practical standpoint, the course addresses the role human-computer interaction (HCI) plays in enhancing the day-to-day human experience and the value of a product to society, while increasing the bottom line for stakeholders. Topics include perception, memory, attention, mental models, accessibility, user/interaction research methods, interface design principles, and design communication strategies.","This course requires competency in Unix and Linux.

Our technological focus will include substantive topics in fundamental problems that blockchain is attempting to solve (and is generating), including algorithms, cryptography, security and trust, autopoietic peer-to-peer networking, distributed ledgers, double spending, proof of work and ownership issues, decentralized applications, smart contracts, and supporting technologies. With that said, this is not a course in economics or monetary theory, trading cryptocurrencies, nor is it a course on regulatory or legal issues surrounding blockchain, although we will touch on many of these topics throughout the course. We will also cover broader applications of blockchain technology beyond cryptocurrencies and ICOs including use cases from finance, insurance, science, healthcare, pharmaceuticals.We will cover cryptocurrencies and bitcoin and mining as well as ethereum initially as our introduction to the problem space, but will quickly move on to building our own blockchain application. Students may leverage a number of technologies including containerization (Docker), as well as the MEAN stack or Ruby on Rails for the more ambitious. Students may work in whatever languages they know best and make the most sense in context. These may include Java/javascript, C++, python, ruby, C#, and others.Laboratories will be offered each week to reinforce a fundamental understanding of the core topics.A final student project will be delivered by teams of students targeting a specific blockchain use case of the team's choice (teams will be given options). | This course requires competency in Unix and Linux.

This course surveys the key practices and processes that help ensure successful projects. It provides an introduction to central activities of software engineering other than just coding, such as planning, requirements, testing and management. It balances this discussion of typical engineering activities against the development process models in which they take place -- specifically, it addresses the tension between traditional plan-driven approaches and adaptive agile techniques. By examining the underlying principles of major development models, it shows how those principles address (or fail to address) the various problems encountered by project teams. Students who complete this course will gain a solid understanding of both plan-driven and agile software development principles and how to negotiate between them in different contexts.The project planning topic of the course begins with project inception and interpretation of the business case and proceeds through project deployment and support. The chief emphasis is on understanding the many interrelated dimensions of a project. It addresses the bread-and-butter planning topics, such as estimation and scheduling, and surveys the dominant models for these tasks. It explains the key metrics necessarily for successful project control and the means of collecting and interpreting them. Significant time is spent on the topic of risk and risk management. The requirements topic introduces a structured framework for thinking about software requirements. It teaches not only how to elicit and capture requirements (an art in itself), but also how to assign appropriate attributes to requirements to enable effective prioritization, management, and validation. The quality topic discusses practices that have been shown to reduce software defects. It examines requirements validation and the traceability of project decisions from user needs, through requirements, to design decisions, implementation, and testing. It shows how key architectural decisions affect product quality, and offers guidelines to determine which decisions must be made up front and which are better deferred. Formal quality verification processes, such as reviews and inspections are explained, as are best practices for designing and administering tests. Finally, change control and configuration management practices are reviewed.Course Contents•Lean software development principles•The seven wastes of software development•Agile methods: Scrum, XP, Kanban, Feature-Driven Development•Estimation of size and effort•Requirements management, elicitation, analysis, specification, verification and validation•Software testing (dynamic)•Software inspection•Iterative and incrementation strategies•Risk management•Software capability maturity•Software project metrics•Change management•Software development life cycles•When -- and when not -- to use various approaches and techniques•Software process management and improvement•Transforming software organizationsCourseworkYou will apply the course material to an ongoing case study, developing work products such as plands, requirements and analysis models.You will regularly be expected to hand in answers (usually brief) to a few questions about the material covered. For example, you might be given a few scenarios and asked to select the appropriate software development lifecycle for each and write a sentence or three justifying your choice.You should expect frequent quizzes, none of which will be worth very many points.

A study guide will be provided for each. The final is cumulative, but weighted toward the latter half of the course.Finally, you'll be expected to choose a topic, such as an agile development practice, and prepare a written overview in which you explain it and discuss its strengths, limitations and applicability.

https://mpcs-courses.cs.uchicago.edu/2025-26/autumn/courses/mpcs-51400-1,MPCS 51400 Functional Programming (Autumn 2025),mpcs-51400-1,—,Core SystemsElective,"COURSE DESCRIPTIONThis course will provide an introduction to software development in the functional paradigm, with a focus on pure, statically-typed functional programming. The functional paradigm isn't a language or technology--it's an entire school of thought on what a computer program is and how to write one. It has a long history, based on a model of computation developed by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 30s. The functional paradigm contrasts with the imperative paradigm, which most of today's existing software is written in. But although the functional paradigm has yet to go fully mainstream, the imperative world has been taking most of its bleeding-edge ideas about software design from the functional world, particularly in recent years. And to all appearances, that trend is on the rise, with expansive new purely functional software and tooling currently under development at companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and countless others. In addition, the library ecosystem for languages such as Haskell and OCaml has become sufficiently rich and extensive that an increasing proportion of today's successful software companies (including Jane Street Capital and Input-Output) have been able to develop their entire code base purely functionally.There are a lot of ways to characterize the difference between programming in the functional style and programming in the imperative style. But just to whet your appetite, the language we will be working with has the following distinctive features:+ every data structure is immutable+ there is no shared state between functions+ every expression must be well-typed at compile time+ types can be inferred, and therefore need not be declared+ data modeling is done using algebraic data types+ functions can be made general-purpose with polymorphic types+ interfaces are built using ad-hoc polymorphism, a.k.a. 'type classes'The language of this course is Haskell. Haskell is arguably the main agenda-setter for the functional paradigm, and it is also somewhat challenging to learn outside of a class. At least in the opinion of this instructor, knowing your way around Haskell puts you in an excellent position to get going with other functional languages. That said, although we will spend a lot of time becoming intimately acquainted with Haskell, the main goal of this class is to focus on big-picture concepts that can be readily ported to other languages and technologies--in some cases including languages with limited support for the functional style. The functional style offers a wide array of data structures, patterns, and techniques that are nearly indispensable for writing clean, modular, maintainable, bug-free code that runs blazingly fast. These are all methods that any software developer can benefit from having in their personal toolkit.COURSE CONTENTThe week-by-week breakdown of topics will be as follows:Week 1: Haskell basics, linked lists, recursionWeek 2: point-free, lazy evaluation, algebraic datatypesWeek 3: type classes, basic IO, Maybe and EitherWeek 4: functors, intro to applicatives and monadsWeek 5: more monads, a little more IOWeek 6: midterm exam, the State monadWeek 7: intro to applicative parsingWeek 8: monad transformersWeek 9: lazy evaluation, conclusion, final projectCOURSEWORKWork for the course consists of short weekly readings, weekly code exercises, a midterm exam, and a final project. The weekly exercises are intended to be challenging but hopefully also fun. They will not presuppose any prior familiarity with functional programming. The bulk of the final project is written piecemeal every week as part of the homework, with the final two weeks set aside for finalizing it.COURSE TEXTBOOKSThe main text for this class is the homework assignments, which are intended to be read week by week, like a textbook. However, we will also be reading the first half ofFinding Success (and Failure) in Haskell, by Julie Moronuki and Chris Martin, which can be purchased here:https://leanpub.com/finding-success-in-haskellMoronuki and Martin's book is simply incredible, and highly recommended for anyone who would like to get started with Haskell.We won't be using any general textbook in this class, but if you are looking for a general-purpose Haskell book to use for reference, Graham Hutton'sProgramming in Haskell(second edition) is excellent:http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html | This course requires competency in Unix and Linux.

In this course,students will be organized into teamsand each team will be provided with a set of (partial) requirements and will be responsible for the analysis, design, design documentation, and implementation in source code of a project that constitutes a complex software system. Each team of students will work through requirements analysis, expression of design using a modeling language, and implementation, and techniques and tools will be provided in order to facilitate the delivery.The progression of design will be peer-reviewed by the student teams. We will work within an ""Agile"" design and implementation framework and adopt agile approaches to lean design. One of our efforts will be to dispel the myth that design is not performed within an agile environment.During the course and lectures, we will cover the following topics:Why is design important, even in an agile environment?Attributes of good design: coupling, cohesion, law of Demeter, generic solutions vs. specific solutionsWhat is the role of modeling in software development?Documenting and communicating software design using the Unified Modeling Language notationLean thinking and lean modelingDesign guidelines for quality, interoperability, modifiability, performance, security, testability, and maintainabilityThe role of patterns in designing software and design refactoringDecomposing systems into recognizable patterns | Core Programming and satisfactory completion of the Unix Bootcamp. | Core Programming and satisfactory completion of the Unix Bootcamp.","Knowledge of Java and/or C++ and/or PythonThis course requires competency in Unix and Linux.
